# Ecli

`ecli` is a portable command line client to access the [Keen Eye](https://www.keeneyetechnologies.com/)
digital pathonolgy platform. Its primary use is to ease image upload to
the platform and get slide information in a convenient way.

This [Go](https://golang.org) implementation is currently a work in progress.
